When a restaurant has been around as long as Tujague&apos;s and has entertained the likes of Cole Porter, O. Henry, Eleanor Roosevelt, Diane Sawyer, Don Johnson, and Dan Akroyd, it must offer more than just good food. Visitors and locals alike want a traditional New Orleans scene complete with ceiling fans, picturesque balconies and a melange of local flavor and at Tujague&apos;s they can get their fill. Long before New Orleans bore the name &quot;New Orleans&quot;, the bulding at 823 Decatur served as a Spanish armory. Today, Tujague&apos;s Restaurant still bears a great resemblance to the Tujague&apos;s of old -- The ornately framed mirror brought over from Paris in 1856 by Guillaume Tujague still stands behind the bar. The cypress bar itself is legendary - As New Orleans&apos; oldest standing bar, it survived prohibition with no liquor and three bartenders. Guest books chronicle 140 years of patronage with signatures of such notables as Ty Cobb and John D. Rockefeller. Dining rooms are modest, yet cozy, displaying photographs of famous and infamous patrons, as well as shadowboxes filled with the restaurant&apos;s extensive miniature liquor/liquer bottle collection numbering over 5,000."],"address":"823 Decatur St., New Orleans, LA 70116","location":{"lat":29.9581337,"lng":-90.06177509999999}},{"title":"Turkey and Wolf","body":["<a href=\"/directory/location.php?locationID=3473\" class=\"listingsTitle\">Turkey and Wolf</a>","739 Jackson Ave., New Orleans, LA 70130 [<a href=\"/directory/location.php?locationID=3473#theMap\">Map It</a>]","(434) 466-1178","<a href=\"http://www.turkeyandthewolf.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.turkeyandthewolf.com</a>","<strong>Neighborhood: </strong><a href=\"/tools/neighborhoodguide/uptown.html\">Uptown/Garden District","</a><strong>Attire:</strong> Casual","<strong>Price Range:</strong> $$","<strong>Open For:</strong> Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner (Call ahead for hours)","<strong>Cuisine Type/s:</strong>&#xA0;American",""],"address":"739 Jackson Ave., New Orleans, LA 70130","location":{"lat":29.9271932,"lng":-90.07431419999999}},{"title":"Turtle Bay Food & Spirits","body":["<a href=\"/directory/location.php?locationID=504\" class=\"listingsTitle\">Turtle Bay Food &amp; Spirits</a>","1119 Decatur St., New Orleans, LA 70116 [<a href=\"/directory/location.php?locationID=504#theMap\">Map It</a>]","(504) 586-0563","<strong>Neighborhood: </strong><a href=\"/tools/neighborhoodguide/frenchquarter.html\">French Quarter","</a><strong>Attire:</strong> Casual","<strong>Price Range:</strong> $","<strong>Open For:</strong> Lunch, Dinner, Late Night (Call ahead for hours)","<strong>Cuisine Type/s:</strong>&#xA0;<a href=\"/neworleans/cuisine/cuisines/barfood.html\">Bar/Pub Food</a>, <a href=\"/neworleans/cuisine/cuisines/pizza.html\">Pizza</a>",""],"address":"1119 Decatur St., New Orleans, LA 70116","location":{"lat":29.96023139999999,"lng":-90.059665}},{"title":"Twelve Mile Limit","body":["<a href=\"/directory/location.php?locationID=2811\" class=\"listingsTitle\">Twelve Mile Limit</a>","500 Telemachus St, New Orleans, LA 70119 [<a href=\"/directory/location.php?locationID=2811#theMap\">Map It</a>]","(504) 488-8114","<strong>Neighborhood: </strong><a href=\"/tools/neighborhoodguide/midcity.html\">Mid-City","</a><strong>Attire:</strong> Casual","<strong>Price Range:</strong> $","<strong>Open For:</strong> Dinner, Late Night (Call ahead for hours)","<strong>Cuisine Type/s:</strong>&#xA0;<a href=\"/neworleans/cuisine/cuisines/barbecue.html\">Barbecue</a>","<strong>Description:</strong> If you&apos;re looking for a low-key place to unwind, spend an evening in this chill Mid-City hangout.
